## Custom component styles

The styles of these components can be customized in your project with a
component's provided [Sass mixins](https://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-6).

1. Add a dev dependency on the
[sass_builder](https://pub.dev/packages/sass_builder) package to your
`pubspec.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  dev_dependencies:
    sass_builder: ^2.0.0 # update for the latest version
  ```

2. Now you can import styles and mixins from this package via dart style package
imports in your Sass files.

  In your `.scss` files:

  ```scss
  @import 'package:angular_components/css/material/material';

  .blue {
    color: $mat-blue;
  }
  ```
