Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/angulardart-community/angular_components/wiki) on how we plan to migrate `angular_components` to null safety, or pick a random [issue](https://github.com/angulardart-community/angular_components/issues) and start contributing!

> I attempt to migrate it to null-safety little by little, perhaps one `dart`
file every day. ~~As the saying goes: a commit a day, keeps the doctor away.~~

[Material design] components for [AngularDart]. Originally written by Google, it
has powered some of Google's most sophisticated and mission-critical [applications].

The [AngularDart Components Gallery] contains live examples and documentation.

This productive and stable set of widgets, contributed to by hundreds of
Googlers, make debugging and deploying your app easier. Strict latency and
testing policies make these widgets an excellent fit for projects using
[AngularDart].
